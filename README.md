🌟 Built a responsive and user-friendly interface using React and TypeScript, incorporating React Router for seamless navigation and authentication tools for secure user login and registration. In order to log in, users must first sign up, and any errors or instructions for signing up will be displayed.


🔥 Integrated Firebase for backend authentication and data storage, fetching data from its API or world REST API to populate the app with movies and TV shows.

🔍 Implemented a search feature that allows users to find movies and TV shows by title, as well as a filter feature that lets them sort between all movies/TV shows, only movies, only TV shows, and bookmarked movies/TV shows.

📈 Created a trending section that displays movies and TV shows that are currently popular, and allows users to swipe left and right to view more content.

📌 Enabled users to bookmark movies and TV shows by clicking on a bookmark icon, and persisting the bookmarked status through local storage.

💪 Leveraged the power of useState, useRef, and other hooks to manage and manipulate the app's state and user interactions, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.
